# input is an array = 2, 3, 1, -4, -4, 2]
# output is boolean
# function returns whether input array forms a single cycle
# every element in array is visited exactly once before landing back at
# starting index
# can use a set to keep track of indexes visited
# len of array
# start at index = 0
# next = index + array[index] % len of array, add next to set
# while next != 0 keep iterating, if there is a duplicate in the set return False
# time complexity is O(n) because you have to visit every node
# space complexity is O(1)
